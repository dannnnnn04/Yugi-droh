# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Dan C**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Yugi-droh** is an android app that displays a random card from the Yu-Gi-Oh! API

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü§ìüòµ‚Äçüí´ü§©**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

<!--The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!-->

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is the **Yu-Gi-Oh! API**.

## Notes

In this unit, I learned how to examine and parse the JSON response. I believe it was the most time consuming portion of this process, as different APIs have structures that can be tricky to extract information from.
